# Achievement Unlocked: A Better Path to Language Learning #

This is a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) based
presentation that was given at [Midwest.io](http://midwest.io) on
Nov 9, 2015.

### Setup

Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli)

4. Clone the midwest.io.mal repository
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/kanaka/midwest.io.mal.git
   ```

5. Navigate to the midwest.io.mal folder
   ```sh
   $ cd midwest.io.mal
   ```

6. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

7. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ grunt serve
   ```

8. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation

   You can change the port by using `grunt serve --port 8001`.

9. Open the speaker notes by pressing 's'. Most of the actual context
   is in the speaker notes.
